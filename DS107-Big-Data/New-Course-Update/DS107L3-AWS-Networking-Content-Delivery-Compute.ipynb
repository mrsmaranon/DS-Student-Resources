Machines convert that decimal number to a binary format in order to use it. For the IP address 192.0.2.0, each of the four dot separated numbers of the address represent a maximum of 8 bits called an octet. This means that each of the four numbers can be anything from 0 to 255. The combined total of the four numbers for an IP address is 32 bits in binary format.

A CIDR address is expressed as an IP address, which is the first address of the network followed by a / (forward slash character). Where the prefix must be steady and not changeable and allocated for the network identifier. The bits that are not fixed are allowed to change. CIDR is a way to express a group of IP addresses that are consecutive to each other. In the above example, the CIDR address is 192.0.2.0/24 where the last octet is changeable and the first three octets are fixed. This means that there are 256 addresses available for this network.

    "#### 3. Network Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second part describing EC2, we'll discuss networking settings, attaching an IAM role, user data scripts, and storage options. After you have chosen and AMI and instance type, you must specify the network location where the EC2 instance will be deployed. The choice of region must be made before you start the Launch Instance wizard. Verify that you are in the correct region within the Amazon EC2 Console before you choose Launch Instance. Within the region, you can sepcify to place the instance into any existing subnet, into any existing VPC. The wizard also provides a link to create a new VPC or to create a new subnet if wanted. In the example shown below, the user has indicated that the instance should be deployed into a specific public subnet inside a specific VPC. If you do not specify a VPC when launching an instance, the instance will be placed in the default VPC. When you launch an instance in a default VPC, AWS will assign it a public IP address by default. When you launch an instance into a non-default VPC, the subnet has an attribute that determines if instances launched into it receive a public IP. If you want to you can override this setting for the instances as you are launching them. \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. IAM role\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to use EC2 instances to run an application that must make API calls to other AWS services. To support these use cases, AWS allows you to create and attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance. Without this feature, you might be tempted to place AWS credentials on EC2 instances so an application can use them to call another AWS service. However, you should never store AWS credentials on an EC2 instance. It's not secure. Instead, attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance. An instance profile is a container for an IAM role. If you use the AWS Management Console to create a role for Amazon EC2, the console automatically creates an instance profile and gives it the same name as the role. In the below example, an IAM role is attached to an EC2 instance to grant permissions to an application that runs on that instance. The application must access a bucket in the Amazon S3. You can attach an IAM role when you launch the instance, but you can also attacha a role to an already running EC2 instance. \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. User data\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an EC2 instance you have the option of passing user data to the instance. User data can automate the completion of installations and configurations at instance launch. For example, a user data script might patch and update the instance operating system, fetch and install software license keys or install additional software. In the below example, user data script is a simple three line Linux bash shell script. The first line indicates that the script should be run by the bash shell. The second line invokes the yum utility, which is commonly used in many Linux distributions to retrieve software from an online repository and install it. The command tells yup to update all installed packages to the latest versions. Line 3, indicates that the wget utility should be installed. wget is a common utility for downloading files from the web. For a w Windows instance, the user data script should be written in a format that is compatible with a command prompt window or batch commands or with Windows Powershell. When the EC2 instance is created, the user data script will run during the final phase of the boot process. By default, user data only runs the first time that an instant starts up. User data scripts can be used strategically to reduce the number of custom AMIs that you need to build and maintain. For example, instead of maintaining software installations and configurations and custom AMIs, consider maintaining separate user data scripts to handle those actions at instance launch. \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Storage options\n",
    "\n",
    "When you launch an EC2 instance, you can configure storage options. For example, you can configure the size of the root volume where the guest operating system such as Windows of Linux is installed. You can also attach additional storage volumes when you launch the instance. Some AMIs are configured to launch more than one storage volume by default to provide storage options that are separate from the root volume. For each volume that your instance will have, you can specify the size of the volumes and the volume type, and whether the storage will be retained if the instance is terminated. You can also specify if encryption should be used or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img  src=\"Media/AWS-EC2-Storage-Options.png\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Amazon EC2\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS)\n",
    "    - Durable, block-level storage volumes.\n",
    "    - You can stop the instance and start it again, and the data will still be there (persistent)\n",
    "- Amazon EC2 Instance Store\n",
    "    - Storage is provided on disks that are attached to the host computer where the EC2 instance is running.\n",
    "    - If the instance stops, data stored here is deleted (non persistent)\n",
    "- Other options for storage (not for the root volume)\n",
    "    - Mount an Amazon elaastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.\n",
    "    - Connect to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you see two examples of how storage options could be configured for EC2 instance. The example for instance one shows that the root volume, which contains the OS and possibly other data, is stored on Amazon EBS. This instance also has two attached volumes. One volume is a 500 gigabyte Amazon EBS storage volume and the other volume is an Instance Store volume. If this instance was stopped and then started again, the OS volume would survive, and any data that was stored on either the 20 GB Amazon EBS volume or the 500 GB Amazon EBS volume, would remain intact. However, any data that was stored on ephemeral volume 1 would be permanently lost. The example for instance two shows that the root volume is on an Instance Store volume type, ephemeral volume 2. An instance with an Instance Store root volume cannot be stopped by an Amazon EC2 API call, it can only be terminated. However, it could be stopped from within the instance OS. For example by issuing a shutdown command, or it could be stopped because of an OS or disk failure which would cause the instance to be terminated. If the instance was terminated, all the data that was stored on ephemeral volume 2 would be lost, including the OS. You would not be able to start that instance again. Therefore, do not rely on Instance Store for valuable, long-term data. Instead, use a more durable data storage, such as Amazon EBS, Amazon EFS, or Amazon S3. If an instance reboots intentionally or unintentionally, \n",
    "data on the Instance Store root volume is still available. \n",

    "In part 3, we discuss tagging, security groups, key pairs, the AWS CLI, and essential information about running insances and instance lifecycle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "A tag is a label that you assigned to an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tags enable you to categorize AWS resources in different ways. For example, you might tag instances by purpose, owner, or environment. Tagging is how you can attach metadata to an EC2 instance. For example, a commonly used tag for EC2 instances is a tag key called Name and a tag value that describes the instance such as WebServer1. The name tag is exposed by default in the Amazon console instances page. It's best practice to develop tagging strategies. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Security group\n",
    "\n",
    "A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls network traffic for one or more instances. When you launch an instance you can specify one or more security groups. Otherwise the default security group is used. You can add rules to each security group. Rules allow traffic to or from its associated instance. When traffic attempts to reach an instance, all the rules from all the security groups that are associated with the instance are evaluated. When you define a rule, you can specify the allowable source of the network communication for inbound rules or destination for outbound rules. The source can be an IP address, an IP address range, another security group, a VPC endpoint, or anywhere which means that all sources will be allowed. By default a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic. The inbound traffic shown below, allows the Secure Shell or SSH traffic over TCP port 22 if the source of the request is My IP of 72.21.196.67/32. The My IP address is calculated by determining what IP address you are currently connected to the AWS cloud from when you define the rule. \n",
    "\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Key pair\n",
    "\n",
    "The last important choice to make when launching an EC2 instance through the wizard is to specify a key pair. A key pair consists of a public key and a private key. It enables secure connections to an EC2 instance. When creating an EC2 instance you can choose an existing key pair, proceed without a key pair, or create a new key pair. You must make this decision be fore you can choose Launch Instances and create the EC2 instance. If you create a new pair, download it and save it in a safe location. The only opportunity you have to download and save the new private key is at the time of creation.  To connect to a Windows instance, you use the private key to obtain the administrator password and then log into the EC2 instance's Windows Desktop by using Remote Desktop Protocol or RDP. To establish an SSH connection from a Windows machine to an Amazon EC2 instance. You can use a tool such as PuTTY which will require the same private key.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img  src=\"Media/AWS-EC2-Key-Pair.png\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Amazon EC2\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To log into a Linux instance, for example by using SSH, you must provide the private key when you establish the connection. After you choose Launch Instances and then choose View Instances, you will see a screen that looks like an example shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img  src=\"Media/AWS-EC2-Key-Pair2.png\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Amazon EC2\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can launch EC2 instances programmatically, either by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or through one of the AWS SDKs. In the below example AWS CLI command, you can see a single command that specifies the minimal information that is needed to launch an instance. \"aws\" invokes the aws command line utility. \"ec2\", invokes the ec2 service, \"run-instances\" is the subcommand that will be run, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n",
    "  <img  src=\"Media/AWS-CLI.png\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Amazon EC2\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand how an instance is launched, lets consider the different states that an instance can be brought in throughout its life cycle. The arrows in the diagram below show actions that can be taken and the boxes show the state the instance will enter after the action. After it's launched from an AMI, an instance will be in a pending state before it reaches a running state. An instance will also initially enter a pending state if it was stopped and then restarted. A running instance is fully booted and ready. Running instances can be rebooted. A rebooted instance stays on the same physical host, maintains the same public DNS name and public IP address, and if it has instance store volumes it retains the data on those volumes. Running instances can also be terminated, if they are they will enter a temporary shutting down state before they're terminated. A terminated instance remains visible in the Amazon EC2 console for a while before the virtual machine is deleted. However, you can't connect to or recover a terminated instance. Finally, instances that are backed by Amazon EBS can be stopped. They enter the stopping state before they attain the fully stopped state. A stopped instance will not incur the same cost as a running instance. Starting a stopped instance puts it back into the pending state which moves the instance to a new host machine. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A public IP address is an IPv4 address reachable from the Internet. Each instance that receives a public IP address is also given an external DNS host name. Any dynamically assigned public IP address assigned to an EC2 to instance will be released when the instance is stopped or terminated. When the instance has started again it will receive a new public IP address. When a public IP address is disassociated from your instance, it is released back into the public IP address pool. You will not be able to specify that you want to reuse it. If you require a persistent public IP address consider associating an Elastic IP address with the instance. To do this first allocate a new Elastic IP address in the Region where the instance exists then you can associate the Elastic IP address with the instance. By default all AWS accounts are limited to five Elastic IP addresses per Region because public Internet addresses are scarce. However, this is a soft limit and you can request a limit increase. \n",
