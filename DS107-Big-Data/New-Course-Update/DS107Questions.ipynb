This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. \\n\\n3) Software as a Service (SaaS) - Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.

Unrestricted access increases opportunities for malicious activity (hacking, denial-of-service attacks, loss of data). \\n\\n2- Amazon S3 Bucket Permissions. \\nChecks buckets in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) that have open access permissions. Bucket permissions that grant List access to everyone can result in higher-than-expected charges if objects in the bucket are listed by unintended users at a high frequency. Bucket permissions that grant Upload/Delete access to everyone create potential security vulnerabilities by allowing anyone to add, modify, or remove items in a bucket. This check examines explicit bucket permissions and associated bucket policies that might override the bucket permissions. \\n\\n3- MFA on Root Account. \\nChecks the root account and warns if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not enabled.
